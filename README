# UCS645 – Parallel and Distributed Computing  
## Assignment Repository

This repository contains my coursework for the **UCS645 Parallel and Distributed Computing** course. It serves as a structured collection of all lab assignments and experiments completed throughout the semester.

Each lab is maintained in a separate folder/branch to ensure clarity, version control, and easy navigation.

## Repository Structure
- Every lab includes its own documentation explaining:
  - Objective of the experiment  
  - Implementation details  
  - Use of parallelism (threads/processes where applicable)  
  - Performance observations  
  - Key learnings and outcomes  

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is to systematically track my progress, demonstrate practical understanding of parallel computing concepts, and maintain well-documented implementations for future reference.
