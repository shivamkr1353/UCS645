# UCS645 Parallel and Distributed Computing

## Assignment Collection and Overview

This repository contains all my work for the UCS645 course. Each lab and assignment is organized into separate folders for easy navigation. Every task includes a README file that explains the implementation, use of parallel computing concepts such as threads/processes, and the key learnings from each experiment.

## Repository Structure

- Labs are maintained in separate folders/branches for clarity and version control.
- Each assignment includes:
  - Objective of the experiment  
  - Implementation details  
  - Performance observations  
  - Key takeaways

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to systematically track my progress, demonstrate practical understanding of parallel and distributed computing concepts, and maintain well-documented implementations for future reference.
